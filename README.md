# rpi_hardware_pwm

Access the hardware PWM of a RaspberryPi with Python. More lightweight than alternatives.

### History

The original code is from (jdimpson/syspwm)[https://github.com/jdimpson/syspwm], I've updated it to Python3 and
made it look like the `RPi.GPIO` library's API (but more Pythonic than that.)
